The `.vim` folder and `.vimrc` is to be put in HOME directory of the user.

Make sure to put a 'dot' before the file or folder name in order to hide it, so that it is not listed normally. Press `Ctrl+H` in nautilus to access them. 

If changes are required to be made to whole of the system, instead of the indvidual user (for which sudo permission is required), put the vimrc file in `/etc/vim`
