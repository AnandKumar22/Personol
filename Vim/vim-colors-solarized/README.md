This is a colour theme I downloaded to use for vim from the website
http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

To use this,

Move `solarized.vim` to your `.vim/colors` directory.

After either Option 1 or Option 2 above, put the following two lines in your 
.vimrc:

    syntax enable
    set background=dark
    colorscheme solarized

or, for the light background mode of Solarized:

    syntax enable
    set background=light
    colorscheme solarized

See `Pre README` for more details.
